      <description>HPC, HTC and Cloud HPC, HTC, and Cloud Computing are modern answers to “too much data”. As given by the facts listed here:
 1.7MB of data is created every second by every person during 2020. In the last two years alone, the astonishing 90% of the world’s data has been created. 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced by humans every day. 463 exabytes of data will be generated each day by humans as of 2025.</description>

      <description>Interacting with a scheduler As shown in the previous note, high performance computing clusters are characterized by a (or several) login nodes. The nodes serve as the gateway to the rest of the cluster. To gain access to the compute power within the cluster, you must “reserve” time on a compute node. This is done through a resource manager commonly termed a scheduler.

 On ARC systems, we are migrating to SLURM which stands for Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management.</description>
